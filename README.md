## Intro and Goal
You might not like to write your diary in a book, and you like typing on your laptop. This is when you use an online platform to write your diary entries. Many people don't really prefer online diary writing sites because maybe the diary app isn't as good as they taught or the user interface was very bad. This is why I am creating a diary website where anyone can create an account and write their entries with satisfaction. 

## Who is it for?
This project is space for people who want to write a diary. They can create an account and start writing an entry every day. I will also make it customizable such as adding images, videos, random stickes, and maybe a calender, a login (setting up an account), and getting reminders at a specific time that they want to get a reminder to write the diary. But my aim is mostly for students, I think that they will be going through a lot everyday and they might be very frustrated or sad or angry sometimes, this could really affect their mental health. And that is the reason why it is good to write a diary, and this is the age group that I am targeting. 

## Why build it? 
Not many Diary apps are very good. So, to satisfy the user's needs I would like to create this website to be the best so that the user is going to have the best experience when using it. 

## Features 
- Sign up/login page
- A calender at the begenning to click on the that the user wants to write the diary. 
- you write your entry and customize the page using different fonts, uploding videos, images, etc. 
- Then they save it.
- You can go back to write another entry tomorrow. 

## User Flow
- They click on the login with google or create an account. 
- Then it takes them to the home page where the calender is located. 
- When they click on the date in the calender, it then takes them to their today's day of their diary entry to write. 
- After writing they can customize their diary and make it look beautiful by adding emojies, images, or videos. 
- Then they can save their page and it automatically takes them to the home page.
