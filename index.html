			<h3 id="goal"> Our Goal </h3>
			<p>
				Our goal is to make every user feel good and have a
				satisfaction that they wrote their diary entry today. The
				reason why I built this website is because in my experience I
				have searched so many websites to write my diary, but in most
				sinerios I never found the perfect website that matched my
				expectations of how a Diary writing website should be.
				That is why I created Diarywise, where you can find the
				perfect user interface and many cool features to
				customize your diary entry. I hope you have a lot of Fun
				while writing your Diary Entries.
			</p>
			<h3 id="features"> Features </h3>
			<p>
				There are so many amazing features in our website. Anyone can create an account can start writing their diary entry  
				every day. It is free to use and you can also customize the things that you are writing. You can make the text size 
				bigger, smaller, use a differnt font or you could even change the color of the font. To start writing the entries you 
				need you first go to the calender page and then click on the date that you want to write on and they start writing it
				Our website is a cool place if you want are looking for a website where you want you write a diary in, it might not be
